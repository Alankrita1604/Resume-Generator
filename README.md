4. Technologies Under the Hood

This project is built using a few key technologies:

-   Python: The backbone of the entire application.
-   Streamlit: Our go-to for creating the interactive web interface.
-   Requests: Handles all the communication with the Google Gemini API.
-   Google Gemini API (gemini-1.5-flash): The brains behind the operation, responsible for generating and styling your resume content.

5. Getting Started: Local Installation

Want to run this project on your own machine? Here's how to set it up:

5.1. What You'll Need

-   Python 3.8 or newer.
-   A Google Gemini API Key. If you don't have one yet, you can easily get it from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

5.2. Installation Steps

1.  Grab the code:
    ```bash
    git clone [Your GitHub Repository URL Here]
    cd [your-repo-name]
    ```

2.  Set up a virtual environment (highly recommended!):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  Activate your new environment:
    -   On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    -   On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  Install the necessary Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit requests
    ```

5.  Plug in your Gemini API Key:
    Open your main Streamlit file (it's likely named `resume_generator_app.py`) and find this line:
    ```python
    API_KEY = "" #api key added in the document which is uploaded on Prolearn 
    ```
    Replace the placeholder string with your actual Gemini API Key.
    Pro Tip: For real-world applications or deployments, it's much safer to use Streamlit secrets (`st.secrets`) instead of hardcoding your API key directly in the script.

6. How to Use It

Once everything's set up, running the app is simple:

1.  Navigate to your project directory in your terminal (where your `resume_generator_app.py` file lives).
2.  Make sure your virtual environment is active.
3.  Launch the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run resume_generator_app.py
    ```
    (Just remember to swap `resume_generator_app.py` with the actual name of your Python script!)

Your web browser should automatically open the application, usually at `http://localhost:8501`. Go ahead, fill in your details, click "Generate Styled Resume," and see your personalized HTML resume appear!
